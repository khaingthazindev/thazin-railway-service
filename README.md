### Laravel Breeze Authentication (Blade with Alpine)

-   composer require laravel/breeze --dev
-   php artisan breeze:install
-   php artisan migrate

### Email verification with laravel breeze

-   use 'verified' middleware in route
-   implements MustVerifyEmail in model
-   set mail config in .env (I'm using smpt with my gmail)
-   in .env
-   MAIL_MAILER=smtp
-   MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
-   MAIL_PORT=587
-   MAIL_USERNAME="your_mail@gmail.com"
-   MAIL_PASSWORD="app password you generated in google account app password"
-   MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
-   MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="your_mail@gmail.com"
-   MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"

### Change dashboard page component style into extend style

<p>You can use x-app-layout because custom component already created under app/View/Components/AppLayout.php. We don't use it so we change x-app-layout of dashboard blade into extend style.</p>

### Tailwind setup
<p>We need to set prefix for tailwind not to conflict with bootstrap4 of adminLTE so I set prefix in tailwind.config.js (prefix: "tw-"). Laravel breeze auth blade files already use tailwind there are too many files to change that is why we need to use [Tailwind Prefix Changer](https://github.vue.tailwind-prefix.cbass.dev/). Add more content paths that we would use tailwind css in tailwind.config.js. And I want to use .scss instead of .css so link .scss instead of .css in vite.config.js and some layouts blades.</p>

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

-   [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
-   [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
-   Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
-   Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
-   Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
-   [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
-   [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
